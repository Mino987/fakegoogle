    <h1> Success Criteria</h1>
        <P> These ary my success criteria</P>
        <ol>
             <li> I want my website to have the most accurate and precise data for my viewers. To do this, my first success criteria will be to have at least 3 graphs using the data from the SDG Indicators site. On this site, I am using goal 2, target 2.1. I will make minimum 3 graphs of different kinds (one may be a map, bar graph, etc.) and I will make them interactive for the viewers engagement purposes. I think this is a reasonable success criteria because graphs are kind of easy to make, the only decently hard part would be making it interactive.</li>
             <li> My second success criteria would be to make my website hook the viewers/audience right from the beginning so that they actually read and go through the rest of my site. I will be creating my hook by adding some fun facts on the home page somewhere that bases back to my SDG and I will use figures to display these. For example, I will have a pie chart with a number percentage on it and some words describing the figure under it which is a fun fact. The reason I will be adding these is so that the viewers stay hooked throughout the entire time they are going through my website.</li>
             <li> My third success criteria will be to make my website fully/mostly interactable and make it so that the viewer is involved in the website. This is coming from past experience. It can be very boring scrolling through paragraphs after paragraphs of text trying to learn off of a website because it's just so boring. That's normal. My goal for my website is to make it so that the viewer is engaged in the website and they don't lose interest in the bigger picture, no hunger. I will be making my website engaging by making a bunch of interactive buttons, having nav bars, having interactive maps and graphs, and by adding features in which the user has to click stuff for things to happen. </li>
             <li> Fourth, I want my website to not only be interactive but to be easy to use. I want all buttons/features to work the way they were planned out and I don't want my website to be confusing at all. Some ways of making my website easy to use are: Titles that describe what everything does, less text more images, have a search bar, add icons onto things because people can recognize icons and keep a consistent theme/colour scheme. I want to make it easy to use so that the user doesn't spend too much time on my website because that will make them bored. Also, if someone has to ask how to do something on my site, it shows it is most likely not a very good website in the end. </li>
             <li> Finally, I want a bibliography on my website that cites all of the sites used. My main reason for making my website is to raise awareness towards hunger and possibly raise some money. If the viewers want more information, then I want to help raise awareness by giving them valid and solid links they can go to to learn more. My site obviously is going to be missing some facts and knowledge, so it is best if they can learn for themselves too because that will still mean my site has succeeded. It would have succeeded because if my goal is to spread awareness, and the viewers are going for themselves and researching even more and going to more links, it shows they were inspired by my site which was my goal from the beginning.</li>
